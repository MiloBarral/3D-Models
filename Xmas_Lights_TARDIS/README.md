Christmas lights inspired by Dr. Who´s TARDIS. Came out with the idea last year and made them for this one. Recently I´ve seen that there is a commercial model, but I like them more in the DIY way :)

They are 2 printed files epoxied together after glueing the smoking paper windows for light difusing. Lights are press fitted.
